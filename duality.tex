%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Gelfand duality}
Let $X$ be a  space, and consider the ring of real-valued functions,
\[
 \mathcal{C}(X)\ =\ \mathsf{Top}(X, \mathbb{R}).
 \]
 This  is a (contravariant) functor from ``geometry'' to ``algebra'':
 \[
 \mathcal{C} : \mathsf{Top}^\mathsf{op} \to \mathsf{CRng}.
 \]
%
It is full and faithful if we restrict to compact Hausdorf spaces and bounded continuous functions  $\mathcal{C}^*(X)$:
  \[
 \mathcal{C}^* : \mathsf{KHaus}^\mathsf{op} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{CRng}.
 \]
 \begin{theorem}[Gelfand duality]
 $\mathsf{KHaus}$ is dual to the category of all commutative rings of the form  $\mathcal{C}^*(X)$ and ring homomorphisms between them.
 \end{theorem}
 \medskip
 
 It then requires some work to  determine \emph{which} rings are of the form $\mathcal{C}^*(X)$!  
 They are called \emph{$C^*$-algebras}.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Gelfand duality}
When can we recover the space $X$ from its ring of functions $\mathcal{C}^*(X)$?

\begin{itemize}
\item The points  $x\in X$ determine maximal ideals in the ring $\mathcal{C}^*(X)$,
\[
M_x = \{ f : X\to \mathbb{R}\ |\ f(x) = 0\ \}
\]
\item The (Zariski) topology on the set $\mathsf{MaxIdl}(A)$ in any ring $A$ has a basis of open sets of the form:
\[
B_a\ =\ \{M \in X\ |\ a\notin M\ \}\, ,\qquad a\in A.
\]
\item If $A$ is a \emph{$C^*$-algebra}, then this specification will determine a compact Hausdorf space $X = \mathsf{MaxIdl}(A)$ such that $A\cong \mathcal{C}(X)$.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{theorem}[Gelfand-Stone-Naimark]
 $\mathsf{KHaus}$ is dual to the category of $C^*$-algebras,
 \[
\mathsf{KHaus}^\mathsf{op}\ \simeq\ C^*\mathsf{Alg}.
 \]
 \end{theorem}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Grothendieck's sheaf representation for commutative rings}

Grothendieck extended this duality from $C^*$-algebras to \emph{all} commutative rings, by generalizing on the ``geometric'' side from spaces to \emph{(affine) schemes},
 \[
\mathsf{Scheme}_\mathsf{aff}^\mathsf{op}\ \simeq\ \mathsf{CRng}.
 \]

The essential change was to generalize the ``ring of values'' from the constant ring $\mathbb{R}$ to a ring $\mathcal{R}$ that ``varies continuously over the space $X$'', i.e.\ a \emph{sheaf of rings}.   
\medskip

The various rings $\mathcal{R}_x$ generalize the \emph{local rings} of real-valued functions that vanish at $x\in X$.
\medskip

This allows \emph{every} commutative ring $A$ to be seen as a ring of continuous functions on a suitable space $X_A$, with values in a suitable sheaf of rings $\mathcal{R}$ on $X_A$.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Grothendieck's sheaf representation for commutative rings}

\begin{definition} A  ring (commutative, with unit $1\neq 0$) is called \emph{local} if it has a unique maximal ideal.
Equivalently: $$x+y\ \text{is a unit}\quad\text{implies}\quad x\ \text{is a unit}\ \text{or}\ y\ \text{is a unit}.$$
\end{definition}
%
\begin{theorem}[Grothendieck]
Let $A$ be a ring.  There is a space $X$ with a sheaf of rings $\mathcal{R}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $p\in X$, the stalk $\mathcal{R}_p$ is a local ring, 
\item for the ring of global sections, we have: $\Gamma(\mathcal{R}) \cong A$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus \emph{every ring is isomorphic to the ring of global sections of a sheaf of local rings}.
\end{theorem}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Grothendieck's sheaf representation for commutative rings}

The \myemph{space} $X$ is the \emph{prime spectrum} $\mathsf{Spec}(A)$:
 \begin{enumerate}
\item points $p\in \mathsf{Spec}(A)$ are prime ideals $p\subseteq A$,
\item the topology has basic opens of the following form, for all $f\in A$:
 $$B_f = \{ p\in \mathsf{Spec}(A)\ |\ f\not\in p \}.$$
\end{enumerate}
The \myemph{structure sheaf} $\mathcal {R}$ is determined by ``localizing'' $A$ at $f$,
\[
\mathcal{R}(B_f) = [f]^{-1}A
\]
where $A \rightarrow [f]^{-1}A$ freely inverts all of the elements $f, f^2, f^3, \dots$.
\medskip

The \myemph{stalk} $\mathcal {R}_p$ is then the localization of $A$ at $p$,
\[
\mathcal{R}_p = S^{-1}A, 
\]
where $S = A\setminus p$.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Grothendieck's sheaf representation for commutative rings}

The \myemph{affine scheme} $(\mathsf{Spec}(A), \mathcal {O})$ represents $A$ as a ``ring of continuous functions'' 
\[
f : \mathsf{Spec}(A) \to \mathcal {R}\,,
\]
\myemph{except} that the ring $\mathcal{R}$ is itself ``varying continuously over the space $\mathsf{Spec}(A)$'' (i.e.\ it is a sheaf).  
\medskip

The local ring $\mathcal{R}_p$ has a \myemph{unique maximal ideal}, consisting of ``those functions  $f : \mathsf{Spec}(A) \to \mathcal{R}$ that vanish at $p$''.
\medskip

It is a ``representation'' of $A$ because there is always an injective homomorphism
\[
A \cong \Gamma(\mathcal{R}) \rightarrowtail \prod_{p}\mathcal{R}_p \,.
\]

\begin{corollary}[Sub-direct-product representation]
Every ring $A$ is isomorphic to a \myemph{sub}ring of a \myemph{direct product} of local rings.
\end{corollary}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}

\begin{definition} A  (small, elementary)  topos is called \emph{sublocal} if its subterminal lattice $\mathsf{Sub}(1)$ has a unique maximal ideal.
Equivalently, for $x,y\in \mathsf{Sub}(1)$: 
\[
x\vee y = 1\quad\text{implies}\quad x=1\ \text{or}\ y=1\,.
\]
\end{definition}
%
\begin{theorem}[Lambek-Moerdijk 1982]
Let $\E$ be a topos.  There is a space $X$ with a sheaf of toposes $\tilde\E$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $p\in X$, the stalk $\tilde\E_p$ is a sublocal topos, 
\item for the topos of global sections, we have: $\Gamma(\tilde\E) \cong \E$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus \emph{every topos is isomorphic to the topos of global sections of a sheaf of sublocal toposes}.
\end{theorem}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}

The \myemph{space} $X$ is the so-called \emph{(sub)spectrum of the topos},  $\mathsf{Spec}(\E)$.\\  
\medskip

It is the prime spectrum of the distributive lattice $\mathsf{Sub}(1)$:
 \begin{enumerate}
\item the points $P\in \mathsf{Spec}(\E)$ are prime ideals $P\subseteq \mathsf{Sub}(1)$,
\item the basic opens have the following form, for all $q\in\mathsf{Sub}(1)$:
$$B_q = \{ P\in \mathsf{Spec}(\E)\ |\ q\not\in P \}.$$
\end{enumerate}

The lattice of all open sets of $\mathsf{Spec}(\E)$ is isomorphic to the ideal completion of $\mathsf{Sub}(1)$,
$$O(\mathsf{Spec}(\E)) = \mathsf{Idl}(\mathsf{Sub}(1))\,.$$

%Equivalently, we could have set:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item points $F\in Spec(\E)$ are prime filters $F\subseteq \mathsf{Sub}(1)$,
%\item the topology has basic opens of the following form, for $q\in\mathsf{Sub}(1)$:
%$$D_q = \{ F\in Spec(\E)\ \ |\ q\in F \}.$$
%\end{enumerate}
%

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}


The \myemph{structure sheaf} $\tilde{\E}$ is determined by ``slicing'' $\E$ at $q \in\mathsf{Sub}(1)$,
\[
\tilde{\E}(B_q) = \E/q\,.
\]
This takes the place of localization.  Note that it also ``inverts'' all those elements $p\in \mathsf{Sub}(1)$ with $q\leq p$. 
\bigskip

For the global sections $\Gamma$, we have:
$$\Gamma(\tilde{\E}) \cong \tilde{\E}(B_\top) = \E/1 \cong \E\,.$$
So the topos of global sections of $\tilde{\E}$ is indeed  isomorphic to $\E$.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}

The \myemph{stalk} $\tilde{\E}_P$ at a prime ideal $P\in \mathsf{Spec}(\E)$ is the filter-quotient topos,
\[
\tilde{\E}_P = \varinjlim_{q\not\in P} \E/q, 
\]
at the prime \myemph{filter} $\mathsf{Sub}(1)\!\setminus\! P$.  
\medskip

One then has:
\[
\mathsf{Sub}_{\tilde{\E}_P}(1)\cong P\,,
\]
so the stalk topos $\tilde{\E}_P$ is indeed sublocal.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}

Again, there is always an injection from the global sections into the product of the stalks,
\[
\E \cong \Gamma(\tilde{\E}) \rightarrowtail \prod_{P\in X}\tilde{\E}_P\,.
\]

\begin{corollary}[Sub-direct-product representation for toposes]
Every topos $\E$ is isomorphic to a \myemph{sub}topos of a \myemph{direct product} of sublocal toposes.
\end{corollary}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek-Moerdijk sheaf representation for toposes}

We have the following \myemph{logical interpretation} of the sheaf representation:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A topos $\E$ is (the term model of) a theory in Intuitionistic Higher-Order Logic.
\item A sublocal topos $\mathcal{S}$ is one that has the \emph{disjunction property}:
\[
\mathcal{S}\vdash p\vee q \qquad\text{iff}\qquad \mathcal{S}\vdash p\  \ \text{or}\  \ \mathcal{S}\vdash q\,,
\]
for all ``propositions'' $p, q$.
\item  The subdirect-product embedding is a logical completeness theorem with respect to such ``semantic'' toposes $\mathcal{S}$.
\item The sheaf representation is a Kripke-style completeness theorem for IHOL, with $\tilde\E$ as a ``sheaf of possible worlds''.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek's modified sheaf representation for toposes}

But this result is \myemph{not entirely satisfactory}, because we would like the ``semantic worlds'' $\mathcal{S}$ to also have the \emph{existence property}:
\[
\mathcal{S}\vdash (\exists x:A)\varphi(x) \qquad\text{iff}\qquad  \mathcal{S}\vdash \varphi(a)\ \text{for some closed $a:A$}\,,
\] 
(we know that we can prove completeness with respect to such).
\medskip

\begin{definition}
A topos $\mathcal{S}$ is called \myemph{local} if the terminal object $1$ is indecomposable and projective, i.e.\ the global sections functor 
\[
\Gamma = \hom_\mathcal{S}(1, - ) : \mathcal{S} \to \Set
\]
preserves coproducts and epimorphisms.
\end{definition}
\medskip

Note that a local topos has \myemph{both} the disjunction and existence properties.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lambek's modified sheaf representation for toposes}

Lambek gave the following improvement over the sublocal sheaf representation:

\begin{theorem}[Lambek 1989]
Let $\E$ be a topos.  
There is a faithful logical functor $\E\rightarrowtail\mathcal{F}$ 
and a space $X$ with a sheaf of toposes 
$\tilde{\mathcal{F}}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $p\in X$, the stalk $\tilde{\mathcal{F}}_p$ is a \myemph{local} topos, 
\item for the topos of global sections, we have: $\Gamma(\tilde{\mathcal{F}}) \cong \mathcal{F}$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus every topos is a \myemph{subtopos} of one that is isomorphic to the topos of global sections of a sheaf of \myemph{local} toposes.  
\end{theorem}
\medskip

This suffices for a \emph{sub-direct-product representation} into \myemph{local} toposes, and therefore gives the desired \emph{logical completeness} with respect to \myemph{local} toposes.  

But conceptually it is still not entirely satisfactory.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}

In my thesis, I proved:

\begin{theorem}[A. 1998]
Let $\E$ be a topos.  
There is a space $X$ with a sheaf of toposes $\tilde{\E}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $p\in X$, the stalk $\tilde{\E}_p$ is a \myemph{local} topos, 
\item for the topos of global sections, we have: $\Gamma(\tilde{\E}) \cong \E$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus every topos is isomorphic to the global sections of a sheaf of \myemph{local} toposes.  
\end{theorem}
\medskip

As before, this gives a \emph{sub-direct-product representation},
\[
\E \rightarrowtail \prod_{p}\mathcal{S}_p
\]
into a product of local toposes $\mathcal{S}_p$, and therefore implies the desired \emph{logical completeness} of IHOL with respect to local toposes.  
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}

The stronger result also gives better ``Kripke semantics'' for IHOL, since the ``sheaf of possible worlds'' now has \myemph{local} stalks.
\medskip

For \myemph{classical} higher-order logic, more can be said:

\begin{lemma}
Every local \myemph{boolean} topos is well-pointed, i.e.\ the global sections functor,
\[
\Gamma = \hom_\mathcal{S}(1, - ) : \mathcal{S} \to \Set
\]
is faithful.
\end{lemma}

A well-pointed topos is essentially a model of set theory.  

\begin{corollary}
Every boolean topos is isomorphic to the global sections of a sheaf of \myemph{well-pointed} toposes.  
\end{corollary}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}

For boolean toposes, we therefore have the  representation, 
\[
\mathcal{B} \rightarrowtail \prod_{p}\mathcal{S}_p 
\]
as sub-direct-product of \emph{well-pointed} toposes $\mathcal{S}_p$, along with its logical counterpart:
%
\begin{corollary}
Classical HOL is complete with respect to models in well-pointed toposes.
\end{corollary}
\medskip

These are \myemph{standard} models of classical HOL, taken in varying (``non-standard'') models of set theory.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}


Taking the global sections $\Gamma:\mathcal{S}_p \rightarrowtail \Set$ of each such well-pointed model then embeds any boolean topos $\mathcal{B}$ into a power of $\Set$:
\[
\mathcal{B} \rightarrowtail \prod_{p}\mathcal{S}_p \rightarrowtail \prod_{p}\Set_p \cong \Set^X\,,
\]
The various composites $\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}_p \rightarrowtail \Set$ are Henkin style, ``non-standard'' models of HOL in $\Set$.

\begin{corollary}
Classical HOL is complete with respect to Henkin models in $\Set$.
\end{corollary}
\medskip

These Henkin models can be taken as the points of the space $X_\E$ for the sheaf representation.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}
To define the \myemph{space $X_\E$ of models}:
\medskip

In the \myemph{sublocal} case, the points were \emph{prime ideals} $p\subseteq\mathsf{Sub}(1)$.
These correspond exactly to \emph{lattice homomorphisms} $$p: \mathsf{Sub}_{\E}(1)\to \mathbf{2}\,.$$

For the \myemph{local} case, we instead take \emph{coherent functors} $$P: \E\to\Set\,.$$
These correspond exactly to Henkin models of (the theory represented by) $\E$.
\medskip

The \myemph{topology} is given (roughly speaking) by basic open sets of the following form, for all formulas $\varphi$:
\[
V_\varphi = \{ P\ |\ P\models \varphi \}
\]

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Local sheaf representation for toposes}

The \myemph{structure sheaf} $\tilde\E$ is  first defined as a \myemph{stack} on $\E$ by ``slicing'',
\[
\tilde\E(A)\ =\ \E/A\,.
\] 
The stack is first strictified to a \myemph{sheaf}, and then transferred from $\E$ to the space $X_\E$ of models using a topos-theoretic covering theorem due to Butz and Moerdijk.
\medskip

For the \myemph{global sections} $\Gamma$, we then have:
$$\Gamma(\tilde{\E})\ \simeq\ \E/1\ \cong\ \E\,.$$

And for the \myemph{stalks} $\tilde{\E}_P$ we have the colimit,
\[
\tilde{\E}_P\ =\ \varinjlim_{A\,\in\int\!{P}} \E/A, 
\]
where the (filtered!) category of elements $\int\!{P}$ of the Henkin model $P$ takes the place of the prime filter.  

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Toward logical duality}

The results for toposes suggest an analogous treatment for \myemph{pretoposes} which would be somewhat better, 
because the models involved would all be \myemph{standard} ones, rather than Henkin style, non-standard models.
\medskip

We then have the possibility of a \myemph{logical duality theory} analogous to Grothendieck's duality for schemes and commutative rings, with  
the sheaf representation playing the role of a \myemph{logical structure sheaf}.
\medskip

This can be seen as a generalization of classical Stone duality for Boolean algebras (= Boolean rings):
from a logical point of view, we have a \myemph{Stone duality for first-order logic}, 
with the classical theory for Boolean algebras appearing as the propositional case.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Boolean algebras and Stone duality}


Recall that for a boolean algebra $B$ we have the Stone space $\mathsf{Spec}(B)$,  defined exactly as for the subterminal lattice $\mathsf{Sub}_{\E}(1)$ of a topos $\E$ (i.e.\ the prime spectrum).  We can represent the \myemph{points} $p\in \mathsf{Spec}(B)$ as boolean homomorphisms,
\[
p : B\to \mathbf{2}\,.
\]

We can recover $B$ from the space $\mathsf{Spec}(B)$ as the \myemph{clopen subsets}, which are represented by continuous maps,
\[
f : \mathsf{Spec}(B)\to \mathbf{2}\,,
\]
where $\mathbf{2}$ is given the discrete topology. (This is just a \myemph{constant} sheaf representation!)


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Boolean algebras and Stone duality}

There is a contravariant equivalence of categories,
\[
\xymatrix{ 
\mathbf{Bool}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[rr]^{\mathsf{Spec}}     &&  \mathbf{Stone}^{\mathsf{op}}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[ll]^{\mathsf{Clop}}  \\
} 
\]
The functors are given just by homming into $\mathbf{2}$.
\medskip

Logically, a Boolean algebra is (the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of) a \myemph{theory in propositional logic}, and a boolean homomorphism $B\to \mathbf{2}$ is a \myemph{model}, i.e.\ a truth-valuation.
\medskip

We shall generalize this situation by replacing Boolean algebras with (Boolean) pretoposes, representing \myemph{first-order} logical theories, and replacing $\mathbf{2}$-valued models with $\mathbf{Set}$-valued models.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lawvere duality}

Consider first the simpler case of equational logic, rather than full first-order logic:
\begin{itemize}

\item In place of a Boolean algebra representing a ``propositional theory'', we have a category $\mathbb{C}_T$ with finite products, representing an algebraic theory $T$ (such as groups). 

\item $\mathbb{C}_T$ may be taken to be the \emph{dual}  of the category $T\mathsf{Alg}_{fg}$ of all finitely generated free algebras and algebra homomorphisms between them.


\item The general $T$-algebras then correspond to FP-functors $\mathbb{C}_T \to \Set$, where the category $\Set$ now plays the role of the ``ring of values'', in place of the Boolean algebra $\{ 0 \leq 1\}$ of ``truth values''. 
\end{itemize}


\begin{theorem}[Lawvere 1963]
There is an equivalence of categories,
\[
T\mathsf{Alg}\ \simeq\ FP(T\mathsf{Alg}_{fg}^\mathsf{op}, \Set)\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lawvere duality and others}

The following dualities are determined in essentially the same way:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Lawvere & equational logic & finite product categories \\
& operations and equations & \\
\hline
Gabriel-Ulmer$^{\strut}$ & relational logic & finite limit categories \\
& operations, $=$, relations &  \\
\hline
Makkai$^{\strut}$ & regular logic & regular categories \\
& operations, $=$, relations, $\exists$ & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


- In each case the ``algebraic'' side consists of a structured category representing the logical theory, and the ``spatial'' side consists of structure-preserving functors into $\Set$, which are the models.
\smallskip

- Recovering the ``algebra'' from the ``space'' (the theory from the models) requires a Stone-like represetation/completeness theorem.
\smallskip

- But the situation with the further logical operations $\forall$, $\Rightarrow$, and $\neg$ is somewhat different, because they have a contravariant aspect that cannot be recovered from homomorphisms of models.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Stone duality for pretoposes (A.-Forssell)}

The further generalization of Stone duality to Boolean pretoposes works like this:
\medskip

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Boolean algebra $B$ & Boolean pretopos $\mathcal{B}$ \\
propositional theory & first-order theory \\
\hline homomorphism & pretopos functor\\
$B\to \mathbf{2}$ &  $\mathcal{B}\to \mathbf{Set}$ \\
truth-valuation & elementary model \\
\hline topological space & topological \myemph{groupoid} \\
 $\mathsf{Spec}(B)$ & $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ \\
of all valuations & of all models and isos \\
\hline continuous function & coherent functor \\
$\mathsf{Spec}(B) \to \mathbf{2}$  & $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B}) \to \mathbf{Set}$\\
clopen set & coherent sheaf 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Stone duality for pretoposes (A.-Forssell)}


\begin{theorem}[A.-Forssell 2008]
There is a contravariant \myemph{adjunction},
\[
\xymatrix{ 
\mathbf{BPreTop}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[rr]^{\mathsf{Spec}}     &&  \mathbf{StoneTopGpd}^{\mathsf{op}}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[ll]^{\mathsf{Coh}} \,,
} 
\]
in which the functors are given by homming into $\mathbf{Set}$.
\end{theorem}

The spectrum $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ of a Boolean pretopos $\mathcal{B}$ is the groupoid of models and isos, topologized by ``satisfaction of formulas''.
\medskip

Recovering $\mathcal{B}$ from $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ amounts to recovering an elementary theory from its models.  This is done by taking the coherent, equivariant sheaves on $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$, using results from topos theory.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Stone duality for pretoposes (A.-Forssell)}

Makkai has found a related \myemph{equivalence}:
\[
\xymatrix{ 
\mathbf{BPreTop}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[rr]     & \simeq &  \mathbf{UltraGpd}^{\mathsf{op}}  \ar@/{}^{1pc}/[ll] \\
} 
\]
We replace Makkai's \myemph{ultraproduct} structure on the groupoids of models by a Stone-Zariski type \myemph{logical topology}.
\medskip

For us, however, the ``semantic'' functor,
\[
\mathsf{Spec} : \mathbf{BPreTop} \longrightarrow \mathbf{StoneTopGpd}^{\mathsf{op}}
\]
 is \myemph{not full}: there are continuous functors between the groupoids of models that do not come from a ``translation of theories''.
\medskip

Compare the case of commutative rings $A, B$:  a continuous function $$f : \mathsf{Spec}(B) \to \mathsf{Spec}(A)$$ need not come from a ring homomorphism $h : A\to B$.

As for rings and affine schemes, we can equip the spectrum $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ of the pretopos $\mathcal{B}$ with a ``structure sheaf'' $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}$,\\
  defined as in the sheaf representation for toposes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item start with the presheaf of categories $\tilde{\mathcal{B}} : \mathcal{B}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathbf{Cat}$ with,
\[
\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(X) \cong \mathcal{B}/X\,,
\]
for all $X\in \B$. This is a \myemph{stack} because $\mathcal{B}$ is a pretopos.
 
\item Strictify to get a sheaf of categories on $\mathcal{B}$. 

\item Use the equivalence of toposes,
\[
\mathbf{Sh}(\B)\ \simeq\ \mathbf{Sh}_{\mathsf{eq}}(\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B}))
\]
$\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ is determined so that this equivalence holds.

\item Move $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}$ along this equivalence in order to get an equivariant sheaf on $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Sheaf representation for pretoposes (A.-Breiner)}

The transported $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}$  is an equivariant sheaf of local, boolean pretoposes on the topological groupoid $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Logically, $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}$ is a sheaf of ``local theories'' on the groupoid of models, equipped with the logical topology.  

\item As before, $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}$ has global sections $\Gamma\tilde{\mathcal{B}} \simeq \mathcal{B}$.  So the original ``theory'' $\mathcal{B}$ is the ``theory of all models''.

\item The stalk $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}_P$ at a model $P : \mathcal{B} \to \Set$ is a well-pointed pretopos: it is the ``elementary diagram'' of the model $P$.
\medskip

\item The global sections functors $\Gamma_P : \tilde{\mathcal{B}}_P \rightarrowtail \Set$ are faithful \myemph{pretopos} morphisms, i.e.\ ``complete models''.

\end{itemize}

In sum, we have the following:

\begin{theorem}[A.-Breiner 2013]
Let $\B$ be a boolean pretopos.  
There is a topological groupoid $G$ with an equivariant sheaf of pretoposes $\tilde{\B}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $x\in G$, the stalk $\tilde{\B}_x$ is a well-pointed pretopos, 
\item for the pretopos of global sections, we have: $\Gamma(\tilde{\B}) \cong \B$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus every Boolean pretopos is isomorphic to the global sections of a sheaf of well-pointed pretoposes.  
\end{theorem}
\medskip

There is an analogous result for the non-Boolean case, with local pretoposes in place of well-pointed ones in the stalks.

The resulting sub-direct-product representation $\mathcal{B}\rightarrowtail \prod_{x}\tilde{\mathcal{B}}_x$ yields:\\[1ex]

\begin{corollary}[G\"odel completeness theorem] 
There is a pretopos embedding,
\[
\mathcal{B}\rightarrowtail \prod_{x\in G}\tilde{\mathcal{B}}_{x} \rightarrowtail \prod_{x\in G}\Set \simeq \Set^{|G|}\,,
\]
with $|G|$ the set of points of the topological groupoid $G = \mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B})$ of models.
\end{corollary}
\medskip

Other consequences of the sheaf representation include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Conceptual completeness (Makkai-Reyes)
\item Beth definability (Makkai)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Logical schemes}

For a Boolean pretopos $\B$, call the pair $$(\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B}), \tilde{\mathcal{B}})$$ an affine \myemph{logical scheme}.  \\

A morphism of logical schemes
\[
(h, \tilde{h}) : (\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B}), \tilde{\mathcal{B}}) \to (\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{A}), \tilde{\mathcal{A}})
\]
consists of a continuous groupoid homomorphism 
\[
h : \mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{B}) \to \mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{A}),
\]
together with a pretopos functor 
\[
\tilde{h} : \tilde{\mathcal{A}} \to h_*\tilde{\mathcal{B}}
\]
over $\mathbf{Spec}(\mathcal{A})$.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Logical schemes}

\begin{theorem}[A.-Breiner 2012]
Every pretopos functor $\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ induces a morphism of the associated affine logical schemes.  Moreover, the  functor
\[
\mathsf{Spec} : \mathbf{BPreTop}^{\mathsf{op}} \longrightarrow \mathbf{LScheme}_{aff}
\]
is \myemph{full}: every map of schemes comes from a map of pretoposes.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[First-order logical duality]
There is an equivalence,
\[
\mathbf{BPreTop}^{\mathsf{op}} \ \simeq\ \mathbf{LScheme}_{aff}\,.
\]
\end{corollary}

Thus the category of Boolean pretoposes is dual to the category of affine logical schemes.
